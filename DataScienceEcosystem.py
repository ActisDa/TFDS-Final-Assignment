# In this notebook, we summarize Data Science Tools and Ecosystem.

# Objectives:
# 
# - List popular languages for Data Science
# - List commonly used libraries by Data Scientists
# - Write markdown and arithmetic expressions on Jupyter Notebook

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. Java

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. MatplotLib
# 2. Seaborn
# 3. SkLearn
# 4. numpy
# 5. Pandas
#
